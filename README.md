Orignally the final project for CMSI 185 with Dr. Andrew Forney at Loyola Marymount University.

## Description:
K'not is a two-dimensional online singleplayer and multiplayer browser
game that employs a top-down interface of players surviving rounds of
a zombie onslaught. Equipped with two unique character classes, players
can use their abilities to protect themselves from enemy zombies (two
enemy types) alone, or with a friend (on the same client). Each round
offers an opportunity to advance progress towards a cure and a healing
potion. Upon death or when the cure is found, the users high score is
automatically uploaded to a highscores list, where players can compete
for the best game.
