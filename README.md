Orignally the final project for CMSI 185 with Dr. Andrew Forney at Loyola Marymount University.

## Description:
K'not is a two-dimensional online singleplayer and multiplayer browser
game with a top-down environment for players to navigate, surviving rounds
of a zombie onslaught. Equipped with two unique character classes, players
can use their abilities to protect themselves from enemy zombies (two
enemy types) alone, or with a friend (on the same client). Each round
offers an opportunity to advance progress towards a cure and to restore health
with a healing potion. Upon death or when the cure is found, the users high score is
automatically uploaded to a highscores list, where players can compete
to have the top rank.
